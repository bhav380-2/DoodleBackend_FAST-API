# Doodle Guessing Game - Backend

- #### Backend is built with **FastAPI** and is responsible for processing doodle data and returning predictions. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on Google's **Quick, Draw!** dataset to predict the object based on the doodle drawn by the user.

- #### It requires the image data to be in **grayscale 1D format** for proper processing by the model.

- #### Backend can be run locally using **Uvicorn**, and it requires **Python 3.8+** along with the dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file. 

- #### CNN model and its training code is available in the https://github.com/bhav380-2/doodleRecognitionModel repository.
